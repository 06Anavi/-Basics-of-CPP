1)Aim-

This repository contains two introductory C++ programs:

    Hello World: Displays a welcome message on the console.
     Simple Calculator: Performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

2)Theory-

C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language derived from C. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is widely used for system software, game development, and cross-platform applications.

This experiment introduces two essential tasks:

    Printing "Hello World" – the classic starting point for learning any programming language.
    Building a Simple Calculator – a hands-on exercise in user input, arithmetic operations, and control flow.

 i)Part A: Hello World-

    Uses the cout function from the <iostream> library to display output.
    The directive using namespace std; allows direct access to standard functions without prefixing them with std::.

  ii)Part B: Simple Calculator-

    Accepts two numerical inputs from the user.
    Performs one of the following operations based on user choice:
        ➕ Addition (+)
        ➖ Subtraction (-)
        ✖️ Multiplication (*)
        ➗ Division (/)
    Uses cin for input and cout for output.
    Applies control flow (if-else or switch) to execute the selected operation.

 3)Conclusion-

   These foundational programs introduce core C++ syntax, input/output operations, and logical control structures in a hands-on way:

    "Hello World" marks the entry point into console-based applications.
    Calculator demonstrates user interaction, arithmetic processing, and decision-making.
